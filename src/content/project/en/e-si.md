During my internship at Groupe Capelle, a transportation company, I was responsible for developing and integrating a C++ solver using Java Spring-boot, PHP, and JS with REST APIs. I worked on an ETL pipeline (Pentaho Kettle) to process and load data into the system using the Java library and native code bindings to call the solver. I also worked on a web application to visualize the results of the solver and aggregate metrics that were displayed on a geographic map on the frontend using the Leaflet library.
