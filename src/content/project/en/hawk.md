I joined the technical team at Hawk as a Scala backend developer. I had the opportunity to work on exciting projects such as developing REST APIs in Scala using the event-sourcing method. I also worked on setting up asynchronous communication between different services in the application using Kafka. I have led workshops on Functional Programming in Scala explaining the design of the Cats library, and on Effect System when dealing with concurrency and parallelism using the Cats Effect library.
