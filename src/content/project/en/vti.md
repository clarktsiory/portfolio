As a consultant at VTI Aéraulique, I developed modules for an ERP and CRM system using VB.NET, TypeScript, and SQL Server. I worked in an Agile environment and provided style guides and modeling solutions. I also worked on custom software to help the company manage their spreadsheet-based inventory, to both document the data schema using UML diagrams and to automate the process of importing data from the spreadsheets into the ERP system.
