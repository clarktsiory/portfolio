In addition to my previous experiences, I have also worked as a freelance full-stack web developer. In October 2020, I developed an e-commerce product catalog website from scratch, using a variety of technologies such as Figma for the design system, Vue.js 3 and Typescript on the frontend, Django and various libraries for the backend, and Docker, Heroku and GCP for the infrastructure. I provided the client with a fully functional website and a custom CRM system to manage the products from an admin UI or using a spreadsheet.

The website is currently live (in French language) at [https://chorusmg.com](https://chorusmg.com).
